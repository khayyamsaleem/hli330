* Creation According to Hesiod
Hesiod (ca. 700) was the first to give literary expression to a systematic explanation of how the gods, the universe, and humankind came into being. This literary expression and geneaology is provided across /Theogony/ and /Works and Days/.\\

In /Theogony/, Hesiod discusses the beauty and power of the Muses. He discusses their ability to inspire the infallible revelations of the poet. He equates their inspiration and its fruits to prophecy.\\

He declares that before all came *Chaos*, a "yawning void." Birds are the oldest of all the Gods.

* Creation According to Ovid
Ovid (ca. 1400) provides another classic account of genesis. Ovid's interpretation of *Chaos* differs from that of Hesiod in that rather than a gaping void, it is a crude and unformed mass of elements in strife from which a god or higher power formed the order of the universe. However, Ovid is Roman, and chronologically far removed from the origins of the mythology he professes.
